## DDoS attack detection in IoT devices using ANN based IDS in a simulated environment
The Internet has expanded a lot in terms of its geographical coverage
as well as its accessibility, since its inception in the late 20th century. With its
rise, the number of devices connected with it are also increasing, especially with
the advent of Internet of Things. IoT devices are being utilized in a variety of
applications and nowadays, they form the base of crucial Infrastructure of a country as well, due to which they are becoming prime targets to being hacked and
attacked for malicious purposes. DoS is one such attack which disrupts the accessibility to the server, restricting access to it for the legitimate users. When it
is carried out simultaneously by multiple devices (bots) then the attack is called
the DDoS (Distributed denial of service) attack. Due to the increasing vulnerability of IoT devices to such attacks and the impact of them in today's digitized
world, it has gathered attention of researchers in this problem domain in the recent past. In this paper, we have focused on the role of Deep Learning for this
task. We have proposed an Invasion Detection System based on Machine Learning which leverages the ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) for combating such
attacks. The ANN is trained on IP traces data to classify safe and hostile packets,
and based on this knowledge it is able to detect a DDoS attack. This framework
is tried out in a simulated IoT Environment and is able to achieve significant
accuracy.
